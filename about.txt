Hi! I'm Meher Sirkhot, a first-year Computer Science and Engineering student.  
This is my very first GitHub project created to learn how version control and collaboration work.  
In this project, I’m exploring basic GitHub features like commits, branches, and pull requests.  
I look forward to building more coding projects and improving my programming skills!
